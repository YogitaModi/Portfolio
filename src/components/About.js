          <p>FULL STACK DEVELOPER</p>
          <p>
            I am a passionate and versatile Full-Stack Developer specializing in
            JavaScript, with hands-on experience in building robust web
            applications. My technical expertise spans modern frameworks like
            React.js, Node.js, and Express, alongside database management with
            MongoDB. Before diving into the tech world, I embarked on a journey
            in Electrical Engineering, where I honed problem-solving and
            analytical skills essential for complex system design. My
            engineering background complements my ability to architect scalable
            and efficient digital solutions. In addition to my technical career,
            I also pursued my passion for entrepreneurship by running a
            successful confectionery business. This experience sharpened my
            skills in operations management, creative problem-solving, and
            customer-centric approachesâ€”attributes I seamlessly integrate into
            my development work. Bringing together a unique blend of technical
            prowess, entrepreneurial spirit, and a creative mindset, I thrive in
            environments that demand innovation, adaptability, and
            cross-disciplinary collaboration.
